                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Digital Communications (ELEC 8900) is a specialized graduate-level course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course focuses on the fundamental principles and advanced techniques of digital communication systems, covering signal analysis, modulation schemes, and system performance evaluation.

### Course Objectives

The curriculum encompasses several key communication domains:
- **Signal Analysis**: Understanding the frequency domain representation of signals and systems using Fourier Transform.
- **Digital Modulation**: Mastering techniques such as Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
- **System Design**: Designing and simulating communication systems using MATLAB and Simulink.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing the performance of communication systems in the presence of noise and interference.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Exploring Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) and other bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and technical implementations compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that the foundations of digital communications remain essential for solving complex engineering problems and explaining them with technical precision. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental communication principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Digital Communications
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were created, compiled, and organized by me during the **Winter 2024** semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.

> [!TIP]
> **Simulation Strategy**: To fully validate system robustness, use these models to simulate adverse signal conditions. By progressively reducing the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** and observing the resulting distortion in **constellation diagrams**, you gain a rigorous, practical understanding of the error thresholds for each modulation scheme.
